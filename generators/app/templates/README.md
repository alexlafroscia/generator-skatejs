## Getting Started

To work on your component, first get your dependencies installed

```bash
yarn install
```

You can run a development server locally using `webpack-dev-server` using:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Linting your Project

[ESLint][eslint] is a powerful tool for statically analyzing your code, allowing you to catch formatting mistakes, detect unused variables, keep your coding style consistent and many other useful things. You can run ESLint on your project with:

```bash
yarn lint
```

but it's even more useful when [run in your editor][eslint-integrations].
